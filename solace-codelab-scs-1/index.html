        <p>Using Java &amp; Spring Cloud Streams (SCS) to create Event-Driven Applications with PubSub+</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of this codelab is to introduce java developers to creating event-driven applications with Spring Cloud Streams and PubSub+</li>
<li>&#34;Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems.&#34;</li>
<li>It is based on Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Spring Integration and Spring Messaging</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#39;re a developer that works for an up and coming car company named Edison Automotives. Your boss is not the most adept in the use of social media but he&#39;s been hearing great things about twitter from his inner-circle and is a bit infatuated with tying it into Edison Automotive&#39;s every day business and culture....little does he know that his company does not exactly have the best products or reputation....</p>

<aside class="special"><p><strong>Developer Resources</strong><br>Spring Cloud Stream Project Home: <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream" target="_blank">https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream</a><br>The latest GA version of Spring Clouds Streams as of the creation of this lab is Fishtown SR2.<br>The Reference Guide for that version is available <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-static/spring-cloud-stream/2.1.2.RELEASE/single/spring-cloud-stream.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="warning"><p>The SCS framework allows for building messaging-driven applications without having to explicitly write any code for publishing or receiving events.  While many microservices-oriented applications today are based on synchronous, request/response interactions based on protocols such as HTTP or gRPC, the asynchronous, event-driven nature of communications using SCS allows for building highly scalable, efficient and responsive distributed systems that can run on-premise or in the cloud.  When combined with the high-performance Solace PubSub+ Event Broker which can be deployed in virtually any environment, you can create powerful and flexible applications that support both hybrid and multi-cloud capabilities, all operating in real-time with high throughput and low latency.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Set-up &amp; Prerequisites" duration="20">
        <ul>
<li>Boss - Glad you made it into work today! Go get setup since we&#39;ve got a lot of work to do!</li>
<li>Developer - Yep, I&#39;ll have everything up and running in 20 minutes or so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Developer IDE &amp; Code Access</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>IDE Setup</h3>
<p>The recommended IDE for the workshop is Spring Tools Suite (STS) <a href="https://spring.io/tools" target="_blank">Download Here</a>. STS comes with some niceties, such as autodeploy, when used with spring-boot-devtools. Participants can of course use another IDE if preferred. It is also recommended that you begin the workshop with an empty STS workspace to avoid any unforeseen issues with existing projects/configurations/code.</p>
<p>Required libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the latest JDK 1.8 (ensure your PATH &amp; JAVA_HOME are updated as needed)</li>
<li>Maven 3.5.3 or higher (ensure it&#39;s on your PATH) <a href="https://maven.apache.org/install.html" target="_blank">Install steps here</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>Code Access</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clone the github repo <strong>TODO - Add real repo &amp; branch info</strong><pre><code>$ git clone git@github.com:Mrc0113/solace-workshop-scs.git
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Import the projects into STS<br>In STS, use the File -&gt; Import -&gt; Maven -&gt; Existing Maven Projects -&gt; Click Next -&gt; Click Browse and Navigate to the git repo you cloned in the previous step -&gt; Select all the pom files and click Finish.</li>
</ul>
<p>After importing everything you should see the following projects in STS:</p>
<ul>
<li>scs-processor-feature</li>
<li>scs-processor-positive</li>
<li>scs-processor-yelling</li>
<li>scs-sink-analytics</li>
<li>scs-sink-bossideas</li>
<li>scs-sink-twitterboard</li>
<li>scs-source-tweets</li>
<li>scs-workshop-common</li>
<li>spring-boot-mspring-boot-mqttwebapp/manifest.ymlqttwebapp</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Note:  There will be errors associated with the template projects as they are incomplete and will be addressed in the exercises that follow.</p>
</aside>
<p>Throughout this workshop we have two options when deploying apps: 1) via the Spring Tool Suite IDE and 2) via mvn on the command line. If you are going to choose option 2 then navigate to the scs-workshop-common directory and perform a maven install of the project.</p>
<pre><code>$ cd ~/git/solace-workshop-scs/scs-workshop-common/
$ mvn install
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create and/or Verify access to a Solace PubSub+ Access</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>PubSub+ Service in Solace Cloud</h3>
<p>If you want to stand up your Solace PubSub+ Service in Solace Cloud go ahead and login or signup at the <a href="https://console.solace.cloud/login/new-account" target="_blank">Cloud Signup Page</a>.  Note that a free tier is available and will work for this workshop.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Local Solace PubSub+ Instance</h3>
<p>When developing your application, you may want to test using a local instance of the Solace PubSub+ Event Broker.  Refer to the Solace <a href="https://solace.com/software/getting-started/" target="_blank">Docker Getting Started Guide</a> to get you up and running quickly with a broker instance running in Docker.  You may skip this step if you decide to use a broker running in PCF or Solace Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Consider removing PCF in this version and adding in the PCF branch only</strong></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Solace PubSub+ Service in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)</h3>
<p>If you are using PCF, your administrator will have created an org and space for your workshop demo in which you can deploy and run your microservices.  Moreover, a Solace PubSub+ service instance will have been created so that it can be bound by any app running in the space and automatically lookup credentials to connect to a broker instance running in PCF.  You should determine the name of this service instance before deploying or running your application to avoid any service binding errors.  You can do this through the Apps Manager or via the cf CLI.</p>
<pre><code>$ cf services 
Getting services in org test-org / space development as user1... 
name                    service             plan                       bound apps  
solace-pubsub-service   solace-pubsub       Enterprise Shared Plan     sample-app

        <ul>
<li>Boss - The marketing department wants to use the tweets to learn more about our customer&#39;s thoughts.  Since you&#39;re already getting them can you share them with marketing?</li>
<li>Developer - That&#39;s Possible!  Tell them to give me a call! TESTING</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>At the end of this section we will have created the apps below!<br>The Source will send out tweets that are received by the marketing Sink.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="1 Application Architecture" src="img/5af0275823434a71.png"></p>
<aside class="warning"><p>SCS Provides 3 Binding Interfaces:<br>1: Sink - &#34;Identifies the contract for the message consumer by providing the destination from which the message is consumed.&#34;<br>2: Source - &#34;Identifies the contract for the message producer by providing the destination to which the produced message is sent.&#34;<br>3: Processor - &#34;Encapsulates both the sink and the source contracts by exposing two destinations that allow consumption and production of messages.&#34;</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploying a Source</h2>
<p>Before our company can do anything with the tweets we have to start to receive an incoming stream of them!  Let&#39;s get started! Please navigate to the &#34;scs-source-tweets&#34; project in your IDE.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Learn the Project Structure</h3>
<p>Before we take a look at the code, let&#39;s take a quick look at the structure of a Spring Cloud Streams project.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a java developer you&#39;ll probably see a familiar project setup. You have your main application under src/main/java and unit tests under src/test/java.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="SCS Project Structure" src="img/f8f42c7c5fde7048.png"></p>
<p>Negative<br>DiagramFifth-windows.png: Spring Cloud Streams is built on top of Spring Boot. A great resource for creating your own Spring Boot applications is Spring Initializr. A publically hosted version is hosted here: <a href="https://start.spring.io" target="_blank">start.spring.io</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Next go ahead and open up the pom.xml file in your &#34;scs-source-tweets&#34; project and search for &#34;binder&#34;; you should have found the &#34;spring-cloud-stream-binder-solace&#34; which is what is going to allow SCS to connect to Solace PubSub+</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TODO UPDATE DIAGRAM BELOW</strong><img alt="SCS Maven Dependencies" src="img/a3b8083e6b669c58.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Let&#39;s take a look at a simple sample implementation in the image below. You can see that the enrichLogMessage method is associated with both an INPUT and OUTPUT channel. In a future section we will create an application following a similar pattern, but notice that if you look at the <em>ScsSourceTweets.java</em> class in your &#34;scs-source-tweets&#34; project you will see something a bit different. We are using an <em>@InboundChannelAdapter</em> annotation in order to create tweets at a fixed rate.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>&#34;Spring Cloud Stream is built on the concepts and patterns defined by Enterprise Integration Patterns and relies in its internal implementation on an already established and popular implementation of Enterprise Integration Patterns within the Spring portfolio of projects: Spring Integration framework.&#34; By using Spring Integration we can make use of familiar annotations such as <em>@InboundChannelAdapater, @Transformer or @ServiceActivator</em></p>
</aside>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="SCS Sample Implementation" src="img/191b59cec4b3474b.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>One last thing to look at and then we&#39;ll deploy your first source! Go ahead and open your application.yml file. This file holds the bindings that tells the SCS binder how to connect your input/output channels to the specified middleware at runtime.<br></li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="SCS Application Config File" src="img/1ec3375dc0672892.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p>SCS apps are not restricted to only using one binder at a time. This allows a SCS app the flexibility of receiving events from one binder/location/environment/etc, performing business logic and then sending new events to another binder/location/environment/etc.<br><strong>TODO think of Kafka to Solace example here</strong><br>Also note that because bindings are dynamically configured at run-time you don&#39;t have to touch the code to switch out your binder of choice, environment info, etc.</p>
</aside>
<h3 is-upgraded>Deploy our scs-source-tweets app</h3>
<ul>
<li>First open the <em>application.yml</em> file and update the host, msgVpn, clientUsername &amp; clientPassword to match your PubSub+ environment. When obtaining the connect info note that the SCS solace binder uses the Solace Java API with the SMF protocol. (Keep this connection info handy as you&#39;ll need it several more times throughout this lab!)</li>
<li>If using STS, start the app by right clicking on the project and choosing &#34;Run As&#34; -&gt; &#34;Spring Boot App&#34;</li>
<li>If not using STS, open a cli and navigate to the project&#39;s directory and then run<pre><code>$ mvn spring-boot:run
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Whichever way you started the app you should see the app start, connect and begin to send tweets by looking at the console.</li>
<li>Developer - Awesome! Now we have a stream of tweets coming in!</li>
<li>Developer - As marketing requested we just need to capture them so they can perform their analytics.<br>To do this we will deploy a sink app.  Recall that a sink app binds to an INPUT channel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploying a Sink</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the &#34;scs-sink-analytics&#34; project</li>
<li>Take a look at the code in the <em>ScsSinkAnalytics.java</em> class; you&#39;ll notice we have a very simple class with only a few methods. As we saw earlier, the <em>@StreamListener</em> attribute identifies which channel our <em>sink</em> method will receive events from. Also notice that the sink method is expecting a POJO tweet parameter of type <em>Tweet</em></li>
<li>Now update the <em>application.yml</em> file for the &#34;scs-sink-analytics&#34; project with the same info that you used when deploying the source app.</li>
<li>Time to deploy!  Deploy the &#34;scs-sink-analytics&#34; app the same way you started &#34;scs-source-tweets&#34;</li>
<li>Now that your sink is started you should see it logging the tweets as they come in!</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Note that Spring Cloud Streams <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-stream/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#_provided_messageconverters" target="_blank">provides message converters</a> which enable the conversion of a payload to/from a specified format/shape (such as a Tweet POJO in our case) based on the argumentType in the method signature and the contentType specified on the message. The default content type is application/json.</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Developer - Woohoo! We&#39;ve deployed our first SCS source and sink applications and the marketing department is now getting the stream of tweets as they requested! Time to give our boss the good news.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>You now have a source application sending events to a sink application via an external eventing system, but notice that you didn&#39;t need to use any messaging APIs! SCS provides this abstraction and makes it possible for developers to concentrate on their business logic rather than learning proprietary messaging APIs!</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Discover the ease of 1-to-Many with Publish-Subscribe" duration="10">
        <ul>
<li>Boss - Hey Tweet Master, I&#39;m loving this twitter thing my buddy told me about!  I want our LED ribbon around the factory floor to become a &#34;Tweet Board&#34; and show all the tweets about our awesome vehicles. The factory team members are going to love it!</li>
<li>That&#39;s Possible!  I&#39;ll get right on it – give me a half hour.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>At the end of this section we will have added the Factory Tweet Board Sink.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="2 Application Architecture" src="img/65be43b4953926f4.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Creating the Tweet Board Sink</h2>
<p>We obviously don&#39;t have a giant LED board that we can use so we&#39;re going to settle for logging the tweets as they come in.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the &#34;scs-sink-twitterboard&#34; project</li>
<li>Open the <em>ScsSinkTweetBoard.java</em> class</li>
<li>Add the <em>@EnableBinding(Sink.class)</em> annotation to label the app as a Sink</li>
<li>Add a &#34;sink&#34; method that takes in a &#34;Tweet&#34; POJO from the INPUT channel and logs that it was received.</li>
<li>Update the application.yml file, verify that there is indeed a destination configured for the input channel, and add your name to the end of the destination name (e.g: TWEETS.Q.BOARD.Marc).  Note that by not specifying a group we are using the &#34;Publish-Subscribe&#34; messaging model.</li>
<li>If not deploying to PCF you&#39;ll also need to update the host, msgVpn, clientUsername, clientPassword in the application.yml file.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Spring Cloud Streams supports multiple messaging models. We are going to use two different ones in this workshop<br>1: Publish-Subscribe allows for an application to process all events sent to the defined subscription. It also allows new applications to be added to the topology without disruption of the existing flow.<br><br>2: Consumer Groups allow for a set of applications to participate in a &#34;group&#34; to consume messages. This option is commonly used to allow the ability for an application to scale horizontally (creating multiple instances of the same application) while only processing each event once.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploying the Tweet Board</h2>
<p>At this point we have created our &#34;scs-sink-twitterboard&#34; application and it needs to be deployed.<br>Time to see if you&#39;ve been paying attention! Deploy it in the same way you deployed the apps in the previous section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Developer - Well that was easy!  I&#39;m loving our event-driven architecture!</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Notice that the publisher (Source) application did not need to be modified in order for another consumer (Sink) application to receive the stream of tweets. There are two takeaways here:<br>1: The publish-subscribe paradigm allows for the publisher to send data once and not care whether 0,1,2 or 100 applications are subscribed on the other end. It just send the data and moves on.<br>2: Developing event driven applications allows for decoupling of your sending and receiving applications. This powerful concept allowed our company to add new functionality without touching our already operational applications.</p>
</aside>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Creating your first Processor" duration="30">
        <p>So far in this workshop we have created source or sink applications. In this section we will create our first processor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey Tweet Master, I&#39;ve got a problem with your work!  This twitter board is letting employees take credit for all the customer&#39;s ideas.  I want to send the new feature tweets to my private page instead of the &#34;Tweet Board.&#34; Can you fix it?</li>
<li>That&#39;s Possible! I&#39;ll do it right away – should be ready in 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>In order to meet our new goal we will add the Features processor and a new Sink as seen below.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="3 Application Architecture" src="img/b93b707ef64e0513.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create the Feature Processor</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developer - Let&#39;s get started!</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>Processor with a Custom Binding Interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open the &#34;scs-processor-feature&#34; project</li>
<li>Note that we have the same project setup as the source and sink apps from the previous section and the pom file doesn&#39;t have any extra dependencies to create a Processor.</li>
<li>Now open the <em>ScsProcessorFeatures.java</em> class.</li>
<li>Note that our <em>@EnableBinding</em> Annotation is specifying the <em>ProcessorOneInTwoOutBinding</em> class; this is because we have specified a custom interface to have 2 output channels (one for tweets with features, and one for all other tweets)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Custom binding interfaces can be defined in order for your SCS app to have additional input or output channels. They also allow for custom naming of channels.</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Go ahead and update the host, msgVpn, clientUsername, clientPassword in the application.yml file; also note that the bindings that are listed include input, outputFeature, and outputNoFeature as defined in our custom bindings interface.</li>
<li>Deploy the app in the same manner that you&#39;ve been deploying the others.</li>
</ul>
<h3 is-upgraded>Processor using Dynamic Destinations</h3>
<aside class="warning"><p>At this point you might be thinking &#34;Okay these custom binding interfaces are great, but what if I don&#39;t know how many or what to call my output channels at design time?&#34; Spring Cloud Streams supports the use of Dynamic Destinations for this exact situation!  Dynamic destinations allow you to use business logic to define your destinations at runtime.</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Let&#39;s create a second feature processor that makes use of dynamic destinations.</li>
<li>Open the <em>ScsProcessorFeaturesDynamic.java</em> class</li>
<li>You&#39;ll notice that the <em>@EnableBinding</em> annotation does not explicitly specify a binding interface. Instead we are using a <em>BinderAwareChannelResolver</em> which is registered automatically by the <em>@EnableBinding</em> annotation. This destination resolver allows us to dynamically create output channels at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>From the JavaDocs, the <em>BinderAwareChannelResolver</em> is &#34;A DestinationResolver implementation that resolves the channel from the bean factory and, if not present, creates a new channel and adds it to the factory after binding it to the binder.&#34;</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Review the <em>handle</em> method to see an example of how to specify dynamic destinations</li>
<li>Open the pom file and update the &#34;start-class&#34; property to point to our <em>ScsProcessorFeaturesDynamic</em> class</li>
<li>Deploy the app</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Note that our two different feature processors are listening as part of a consumer group so they will receive messages in a round robin fashion</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create the Feature Sink for the Boss</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the &#34;scs-sink-bossideas&#34; project</li>
<li>Open the <em>ScsSinkBossideas.java</em> class</li>
<li>Add the <em>@EnableBinding(Sink.class)</em> annotation to label the app as a Sink</li>
<li>Add a &#34;sink&#34; method that takes in a &#34;Tweet&#34; POJO from the INPUT channel and logs that it was received.</li>
<li>Update the application.yml file and verify that there is indeed a destination &amp; group configured for the input channel. Note that by specifying a group we are now using the consumer group model. Since this application will likely do further processing in the future we want to provide the option of scaling up to keep up with the number of events that come in.</li>
<li>At this point we have created our &#34;scs-sink-bossideas&#34; application and it needs to be deployed. Time to see if you&#39;ve been paying attention! Deploy it in the same way you deployed the apps in the previous section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Update the Tweet Board Subscription</h2>
<p>Note that our processor that we created earlier in this lab publishes to multiple topics essentially splitting our feed into two. Due to our new requirements to not show new features on the twitter board we need to update that sink appropriately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your &#34;scs-sink-twitterboard&#34; project</li>
<li>Open your application.yml file</li>
<li>Update the queueAdditionalSubscriptions property to listen on &#34;T/tweets/stream/nofeatures&#34;</li>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>If you are using STS you should notice that the application automatically redepoyed; that&#39;s because of the auto deployment feature provided by spring-boot-devtools</li>
<li>If you are not using STS please stop your running app and redeploy.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>spring-boot-devtools is handy for development and adds features such as automatic restart and remote debugging. Click <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-devtools" target="_blank">here</a> for a high level overview of some of the functionality it provides.</p>
</aside>
<aside class="special"><p>Notice that the use of topic hierarchies provides an organized way of keeping track of your event streams. This ability, combined with the ability to wildcard in PubSub+ gives your applications an easy way to subscribe to the exact event streams necessary to meet your need. Don&#39;t underestimate the value of creating a well-defined topic hierarchy! A few best practices to keep in mind are: start general and become more specific as more levels are added, use short words or abbrevations as topics can only be so long, and don&#39;t mix upper and lower case! A good topic hierarchy might be defined as &#34;&lt;country&gt;/&lt;state&gt;/&lt;locality&gt;&#34; which would allow you to subscribe to all events in a given country &#34;canada/&gt;&#34; or even subscribe to events from all 1,716 localities named San Jose no matter what country or state they&#39;re in &#34;*/*/sanjose&#34;<br></p>

<li>Developer - &#34;Yep, that&#39;s possible - let me get right on that!&#34;</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Spring Cloud Streams currently has two different ways to follow a Reactive (Functional) Programming Model: Spring Cloud Functions and spring-cloud-stream-reactive. We&#39;re going to concentrate on Spring Cloud Functions since the latter option is marked for deprecation.</p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>We&#39;re going to add a &#34;No Yelling&#34; processor in our event driven architecture in order to meet this new need.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="4 Application Architecture" src="img/298fb1849fed7b70.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploying a SCS Processor using Spring Cloud Functions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your &#34;scs-processor-yelling&#34; project</li>
<li>Open your pom.xml file and note that it was not necessary to include Spring Cloud Functions as a dependency. It&#39;s included as a dependency of the &#34;spring-cloud-steam&#34; artifact.</li>
<li>Open the <em>ScsProcessorYelling.java</em> class and note that although we still have the <em>@EnableBinding(Processor.class)</em> annotation we are now bindings a bean of type &#34;java.util.function.Function&#34; to the external destinations by providing the spring.cloud.stream.function.definition property.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Spring Cloud Functions supports 3 types that conveniently map to our 3 SCS binding interfaces.<br>java.util.function.Function maps to a SCS Processor<br>java.util.function.Supplier maps to a SCS Source<br>java.util.function.Consumer maps to a SCS Sink</p>

<li>Now that we&#39;ve seen how to create a SCS app using Spring Cloud Functions go ahead and deploy it.</li>
<li>After deploying you should start to see the BEFORE and AFTER log entries scrolling across the console where the AFTER log entries do not contain any uppercase letters in the text field.</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>From the Spring docs, Spring Cloud Functions allows you to &#34;Decouple the development lifecycle of business logic from any specific runtime target so that the same code can run as a web endpoint, a stream processor, or a task.&#34;  Read more here: <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function" target="_blank">https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-function</a></p>

        <ul>
<li>Hey Tweet Master – we&#39;re still receiving a bunch of complaints and negative tweets...I&#39;m looking like an idiot here.  Fix it now!  And while you&#39;re at it create some upbeat positive tweets!  I don&#39;t want people seeing our cars break down or catch on fire and explode!</li>
<li>Ummm...sure I guess I can do that.<br></li>
</ul>
<aside class="warning"><p>Obviously this company has some morality issues :)<br>In the real world you should definitely not modify people&#39;s speech or create fake news!<br></p>

<h2 is-upgraded>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>A processor will be added to our architecture in order to convert negative words to positive ones.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="5 Application Architecture" src="img/49dc419bfeeda384.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create the Processor</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s get started and hopefully have a bit of fun!</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the &#34;scs-processor-positive&#34; project</li>
<li>Find &amp; Open the <em>ScsProcessorPositive.java</em> class. At this point we know how to create and deploy a processor so we&#39;ll do something a bit different. At the top of the class you&#39;ll see that the negToPosMap object is being initialized in a static method. This Map holds the key for changing our negative tweets to positive ones. Go ahead and fill in some positive words for each negative one in the map. Remember that you can find the canned tweets in the canned_tweets.txt file under the &#34;scs-source-tweets&#34; project if you need some more context :)</li>
</ul>
<aside class="special"><p>Notice that multiple processors can easily be connected together in order to form a processing chain.</p>
</aside>
<h2 is-upgraded>Update the feeds that you want to receive this data</h2>
<h3 is-upgraded>Update the tweetboard</h3>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to your &#34;scs-sink-twitterboard&#34; project</li>
<li>Open your application.yml file</li>
<li>Update the queueAdditionalSubscriptions property to listen on &#34;T/tweets/stream/nofeatures&#34;</li>
<li>Save the file</li>
<li>If you are using STS you should notice that the application automatically redepoyed; that&#39;s because of the auto deployment feature provided by spring-boot-devtools</li>
<li>If you are not using STS please stop your running app and redeploy.</li>
</ul>

        <ul>
<li>Boss - Good job Tweet Master!  Now everyone is looking at me like the genius I am.  Look at all those amazing tweets coming through.  Unfortunately only the people in the factory can see them.  Can you create a webpage so people in the offices can see them too?</li>
<li>Developer - &#34;Sure thing, I&#39;ll whip up a webapp that any of our employees can access!&#34;</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Application Architecture</h2>
<p>To meet this new requirement we are going to add the MQTT Web App shown in the diagram below:</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="6 Application Architecture" src="img/b213cf52b70c2752.png"></p>
<aside class="special"><p>Since we&#39;re using Solace PubSub+ as our event broker we support a bunch of open standards and protocols. Even though the SCS apps are sending/receiving events using the Java API other applications can still use their language/protocol of choice.</p>
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Since we&#39;re Spring experts let&#39;s go ahead and whip up a quick Spring Boot app that uses JavaScript and the open source MQTT Paho library to connect to PubSub+ and receive the stream of tweets.<br></li>
<li>Open the &#34;spring-boot-mqttwebapp&#34; project</li>
<li>Check out the <em>pom.xml</em> file and notice that there is nothing spring-cloud-streams related; only spring boot!</li>
<li>Then open up the <em>mqttListener.html</em> to see how simple it was to connect &amp; receive events using MQTT Paho.</li>
<li>In <em>mqttListener.html</em> update the host/port/username/vpn/credentials to connect to PubSub+ (Search for &#34;UPDATE&#34; to find where the updates need to be made)</li>
<li>Lastly look at the <em>MqttWebApp.java</em> class.  You&#39;ll see that we just have a simple RestController that is smart enough to make the files in src/main/resources/static available for HTTP access.</li>
<li>Now that we&#39;ve taken a look at how the app works go ahead and deploy it.</li>
<li>Once deployed navigate to <em>http://</em>/mqttListener.html to see the incoming tweets! (You can lookup your route in the apps manager or by using the command below:<pre><code>$ cf app spring-boot-mqttwebapp
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Review</h2>
<ul>
<li>Boss - Thank&#39;s tweet master! You&#39;ve done an excellent job today - take the rest of the day off and go get yourself a drink!</li>
<li>Developer - That&#39;s Possible!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully you not only learned how to use Spring Cloud Streams today, but also how it enables developers to concentrate on achieving business goals by removing the need to learn messaging APIs. You should also now have a solid understanding of how implementing an event-driven architecture allows for loose coupling between your apps which enables rapid addition of new functionality.</p>
